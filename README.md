## Interface
Your selected options are saved when you change them.
- To change your location, click on the location name in the center of the window.
- Toggle 24-hour time notation off and on using the **[ T ]** key.
- To toggle debug information, use the **[ D ]** key.

## Search functionality
You can filter locations in the search interface in a variety of ways:
- by location name: type in the name of the location you're looking for (e.g. "Lorville").
- by celestial body: type in the name of the celestial body you're looking for (e.g. "Daymar").
- by current precise time: type in the time you're looking for (e.g. "12:00").
- by current day phase: type in the day phase you're looking for (valid queries: "Night" "Twilight" "Starrise" "Morning" "Noon" "Afternoon" "Starset").

You can also combine queries using the **[ + ]** symbol (e.g. "Daymar+Afternoon" will return all locations on Daymar where the local time is in the afternoon).
